The Arduino folder holds all the code to run Wall-E. 
Lots of folders inside the Arduino folder are for testing purposes and not needed to actually run Wall-E.

All that is needed to run Wall-E:
Upload all files under angleTester to the Arduino with the motor shield and IMU.
Upload slaveMain to the slave Arduino which holds all the distance sensors.
